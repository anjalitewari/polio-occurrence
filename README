Polio Occurrences : 1980 - 2016
This web app tracks all the occurrences of Polio around the world between the years 1980 and 2016 per country.

Data for this app was found from the WHO website. It was in .xls format by default and I converted it to geoJSON after adding latitude, longitude information to each country. I used the approximate center of each country to populate the location points.
To create the map I used Leaflet, for the temporal aspect I used rangeslider, and I used circleMarkers to display the number and relative scale of occurrences in each country.
The temporal slider starts at 1980 and can slide all the way to 2016.
The side panel displays a list of checkboxes for each country that had occurrences of Polio for the year, which is selected by the slider. 
Finally, the site is hosted on heroku and source code for the site is available on github under the MIT license.
